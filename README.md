# Cyclistic Bike-Share : Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

This repository contains Google Data Analytics Capstone - Case Study 1 project, which is the final stage of the Google Data Analytics course on coursera.

**Introduction**
This case study focuses on Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company. The goal of the project is to explore data-driven insights that can help address key business questions. By applying the data analysis process (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act), I will thoroughly investigate how different customer segments use Cyclisticâ€™s services. The analysis will include examining trip patterns, usage trends, and differences between user types, such as annual members and casual riders. The findings will be used to provide actionable recommendations that can help Cyclistic optimize its services and enhance customer engagement.
